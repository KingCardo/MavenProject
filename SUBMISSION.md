## Your Response

### Which aspects of the codebase did you choose to work on and why?

// First thing I did was review codebase to make sure I understood everything
//Then started refactoring code base to be progrommatic instead of storyboards
//Got rid of magic numbers and string and placed in extension for readability and maintainability
//Then focused on refactoring each scene to use MVVM

//I started with this route because I think having a good architecture and clean code base is top priority and will improve velocity for future stories while minimizing complexities.
